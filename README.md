# optionPricing


All these prog are wroten during the work

I just caught some def function from a prog, so some py file may not be functional ( I will complete them later

****

For now, we have BAW model, CRR model, Monte Carlo method and Black Scholes model for option pricing.

BAW is specially for American option

CRR model is mostly for American option, while it can also be used in European option

Monte Carlo method is mostly for path dependent option, such as barrier option, binomial option, asian option
